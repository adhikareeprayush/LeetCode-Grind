# LeetCode Daily Solutions in C++

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, including the daily Problem of the Day (POTD).

## Repository Structure

- `/daily-problems`: Solutions to the daily LeetCode problems.
- `/topic-wise`: Solutions organized by data structure or algorithm topic.

## File Naming Convention

Each solution file follows this format:

```
#problemNumber_problem-name.cpp
```

Example: `#01_two-sum.cpp`

## Solution Structure

Each file includes:

1. Problem statement
2. Approach explanation
3. Time and space complexity analysis
4. C++ implementation
5. Example test cases

## Goals

- Solve at least one problem daily
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Learn and implement efficient algorithms
- Strengthen C++ programming skills

## Progress

I'll update this section periodically to track my progress.

## Contribution

Feel free to open issues for discussions or suggestions on improving solutions.

## Disclaimer

These solutions represent my current understanding and approach. There may be more optimal solutions available.
